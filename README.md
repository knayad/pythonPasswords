# pythonPasswords

# about 
Passwords are the linchip for many programs to keep your information safe. Generally, the more complex a password, the safer your information. However, many people re-use passwords and only make minor modifications to them. This can compromise the security of the applications we use. This python project aims to generate more complex passwords.

# run
This program should not require any extra module installations, since Tkinter should already be build-in. However, if there is a run error, try reinstalling python.
