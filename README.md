# pythonPasswords

# about 
Passwords are the linchip for many programs to keep your information safe. Generally, the more complex a password, the safer your information. However, many people re-use passwords and only make minor modifications to them. This can compromise the security of the applications we use by putting the authentication process at risk. This python project aims to generate more complex passwords.

# run
This program should not require any extra module installations, since Tkinter should already be build-in. However, if there is a run error, try reinstalling python.

# additional information
The idea for this project was found on Python Geeks and can be found here: https://pythongeeks.org/python-password-generator/#google_vignette
